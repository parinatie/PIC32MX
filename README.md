##Introduction
Thank you for purchasing the Swadeshee Parinati PIC32MX Development Board. This board provides a low-cost, modular development system for Microchip’s PIC32MX 32-bit microcontroller. The Development Board comes pre-loaded with demonstration software for the user to explore the new features of the PIC32MX. It is also expandable through pin headers for external interface, which allows the user to extend its functionality. The PIC32MX Development Board also supplies on-board circuitry and consists of bootloader firmware for flash programming with USB port.
